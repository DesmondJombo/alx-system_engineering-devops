Reasoning:
- Load Balancer (HAproxy): Added to distribute the incoming traffic and ensure high availability
. It helps prevent overloading a single server, ensuring better performance and fault tolerance.
- Second Application Server: To enhance scalability and handle increased traffic. It provides redundancy in case one server fails.
- MySQL Database: Centralized storage for data, allowing both Application Servers to access and update information. 
This follows a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster setup.
Distribution Algorithm:
- The Load Balancer is configured with a Round Robin distribution algorithm, ensuring that each Application Server gets an equal share of incoming requests.
Active-Active vs. Active-Passive:
- The setup is Active-Active, where both Application Servers actively handle requests simultaneously. 
This enhances performance and fault tolerance compared to an Active-Passive setup, where only one server is active, and the other serves as a backup.
Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Database Cluster:
- The Primary (Master) node accepts write operations and replicates data to the Replica (Slave) node. This ensures data consistency and availability.
- The Replica node is used for read operations, reducing the load on the Primary node.
Issues with the Infrastructure:
1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF): The Load Balancer is a potential SPOF. If it fails, incoming traffic won't be distributed, causing a service outage.
2. Security Issues:
   - No Firewall: Lack of a firewall exposes the servers to security threats. Implementing a firewall is crucial for restricting unauthorized access.
   - No HTTPS: The absence of HTTPS encryption poses a security risk. Adding an SSL certificate is essential to secure data in transit.
3. No Monitoring: Without monitoring tools, it's challenging to identify and address performance issues, security breaches, or server failures promptly. Implementing monitoring solutions is crucial for infrastructure health.
