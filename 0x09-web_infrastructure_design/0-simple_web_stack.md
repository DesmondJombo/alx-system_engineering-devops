Design of a Single Server Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com:

1. User Access:
   - A user initiates a request to access www.foobar.com.

2. Server (8.8.8.8):
   - The server, located at IP address 8.8.8.8, plays a central role in hosting the entire web infrastructure.

3. Domain Name (www.foobar.com):
   - A domain name (www.foobar.com) serves as a human-readable alias for the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
   - The DNS record associated with www is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record, pointing to the domain itself (www.foobar.com).

4. Web Server (Nginx):
   - Nginx acts as the web server, handling HTTP requests from users.
   - It serves static content and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

5. Application Server:
   - The application server runs the code base for the website.
   - It processes dynamic content requests, communicates with the database, and generates HTML pages to be sent back to the web server.

6. Application Files (Code Base):
   - The application files represent the website's source code, executed by the application server to generate dynamic content.

7. Database (MySQL):
   - MySQL serves as the relational database management system, storing and retrieving data for the website.
   - The application server communicates with the database to fetch or update information based on user requests.

8. Communication with User's Computer:
   - The server uses the HTTP/HTTPS protocol to communicate with the user's computer.
   - When a user requests www.foobar.com, the request is forwarded through the DNS system, reaching the server's IP address.

Specifics:

- Server: 
  - A physical or virtual machine that hosts and manages the entire web infrastructure.

- Domain Name:
  - A human-readable alias for the server's IP address, facilitating user-friendly access.

- DNS Record (www):
  - www is a CNAME record pointing to the domain itself (www.foobar.com).

- Web Server:
  - Nginx handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

- Application Server:
  - Executes the code base, processes dynamic content requests, and communicates with the database.

- Database:
  - MySQL stores and retrieves data for the website.

- Communication Protocol:
  - HTTP/HTTPS protocols are used for communication between the user's computer and the server.

Issues:

1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
   - The entire infrastructure relies on a single server, leading to potential downtime if the server fails.

2. Downtime during Maintenance:
   - Deploying new code or performing maintenance requires restarting the web server, resulting in downtime.

3. Scaling Challenges:
   - Inability to scale efficiently in the face of increased traffic, limiting the website's performance during traffic.
